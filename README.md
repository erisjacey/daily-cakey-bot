# Description

A simple Telegram bot for generating random dessert recipes from an online source.

This is my first solo non-school-based project and I really enjoyed the one day it took for development.

I kept extensibility and code quality in mind, and intend to revisit (and improve on) this project sometime in the near future. 

# Commands
1. **/start** -- Prompts user to enter a valid command
2. **/pls** -- Fetches a random dessert recipe

# APIs/Tools
